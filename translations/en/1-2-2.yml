COMPARABILITY: >2-
   <p> Similar to VSDGI 1.2.1, this indicator reflects part of the global SDG target “1.3.1. Proportion of population covered by social protection floors/systems, by sex, distinguishing children, unemployed persons, older persons, persons with disabilities, pregnant women, newborns, work-injury victims and the poor and the vulnerable”. </p>
   <p> Due to the specificity of Vietnam, there is no clear concept of the term "social protection". Social protection is close to the concept of social assistance, which is one of the three basic pillars of the welfare system. With the purpose of overcoming risks, social assistance together with social insurance have the function of reducing risks, and proactive labor market policies to prevent risks for people. Therefore, to replace the global indicator 1.3.1, Vietnam uses this indicator along with some related indicators of Vietnam such as: </p>
   <p> 1.2.1. Number of people paying social insurance, health insurance and unemployment insurance </p>
   <p> 1.2.3. Number of people receiving monthly social support in the community. </p>
   <p> 1.2.4. Number of people receiving unexpected social support </p>
   <p> 1.2.5. Number of people being concentratedly raised in social protection establishments and social houses </p>
