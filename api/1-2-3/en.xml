 &lt;p&gt; Due to the specificity of Vietnam, there is no clear concept of the term &quot;social protection&quot;. Social protection is close to the concept of social assistance, which is one of the three basic pillars of the welfare system. With the purpose of overcoming risks, social assistance together with social insurance have the function of reducing risks, and proactive labor market policies to prevent risks for people. Therefore, to replace the global indicator 1.3.1, Vietnam uses this indicator along with some related indicators of Vietnam such as: &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt; 1.2.1. Number of people paying social insurance, health insurance and unemployment insurance &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt; 1.2.2. Number of people entitled to social insurance, health insurance and unemployment insurance &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt; 1.2.4. Number of people receiving unexpected social support &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt; 1.2.5. Number of people being concentratedly raised in social protection establishments and social houses &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; - Circular No. 03/2019/TT-BKHĐT dated January 22, 2019 stipulating the set of statistical indicators for sustainable development of Vietnam; &lt;/p&gt;
