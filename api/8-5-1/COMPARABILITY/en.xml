	<message>The COMPARABILITY field for indicator 8-5-1, translated into en</message>
	<data> &lt;p&gt; This indicator corresponds to the global SDG target 8.5.1: Average hourly earnings of employees, by sex, age, occupation and persons with disabilities &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt; There are some differences between the Vietnam indicator and the global indicator: &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt; + Global average hourly earnings; &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt; + Vietnam calculates average monthly income. &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt; Global disaggregated by people with disabilities; Vietnam has not calculated according to this sub-category. &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt; In addition, the diversity of data sources also greatly affects international comparability, as each source type has its own scope and characteristics. It is not entirely accurate to compare, for example, the hourly earnings from the labor census for one country with the hourly earnings from the enterprise census for another country. The use of non-standard definitions and heterogeneity of criteria leads to no guarantee of international comparison. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
