	<message>The COLL_METHOD field for indicator 3-9-1, translated into en</message>
	<data> &lt;p&gt; This indicator was collected by the Ministry of Health through the Adult Tobacco Use Survey (GATS). &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt; The 2015 GATS in Viet Nam was designed to be nationally representative, for all males and females aged 15 years and older per household, not living in centralized facilities. The sample size was calculated to get accurate estimates of the important variables by gender and urban/rural area. This survey applied a stratified random sampling design, in two phases. In the first sampling stage, the basic sample unit (PSU) is an enumeration area (EA). On average, each enumeration area in urban areas has 133 households and each enumeration area in rural areas has 120 households. The sample frame is 15% of the master sample of Vietnam covering 170,000 enumeration areas. The samples of the GATS 2015 survey in Vietnam were randomly selected and stratified using the proportional probability sample size approach. &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt; The GATS 2015 Vietnam questionnaire includes basic and optional questions related to the situation in Vietnam. The questionnaire consists of 10 parts: including: General information; Smoke; Smoking e-cigarettes; Smokeless tobacco; Smoking cessation; Passive smoking; Economy; The media; Knowledge, attitude and awareness about tobacco harms; Observe health warnings on tobacco product packaging. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
