	<message>The COMPARABILITY field for indicator 4-1-4, translated into en</message>
	<data> &lt;p&gt; Indicator “Rate of students graduating from lower secondary school; the rate of students completing lower secondary school, the rate of transition from primary to lower secondary school” is one of Vietnam&apos;s indicators to represent the global sustainable development indicator “&lt;strong&gt; 4.1. 1: &lt;/strong&gt; Proportion of children and young people: (a) in grades 2/3; (b) at the end of primary; and (c) at the end of lower secondary achieving at least a minimum proficiency level in (i) reading and (ii) mathematics, by sex” &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt; However, the indicator does not guarantee global comparability because the content, scope and calculation method of Vietnam are not the same as the global standard. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
