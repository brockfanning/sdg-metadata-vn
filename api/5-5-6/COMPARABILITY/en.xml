	<message>The COMPARABILITY field for indicator 5-5-6, translated into en</message>
	<data> &lt;p&gt; The indicator “Proportion of female farm owners” is one of the indicators reflecting the global level indicator “5.5.2: Proportion of women in managerial positions”. At the global level, it is recommended to collect this indicator through workforce surveys or modular integrated surveys of employment. However, in Vietnam this indicator is collected through the Census of Rural, Agriculture and Fisheries and the content, scope of Vietnam is narrower than the global one, so it does not guarantee international comparability. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
