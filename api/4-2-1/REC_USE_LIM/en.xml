	<data> &lt;p&gt; Another tool to measure early childhood development is the Early Childhood Development Index (ECDI), which is calculated as the percentage of children aged 36-59 months who are on track for at least 3 of 4 areas, including: reading writing-computational, physical, social-emotional and academic. Currently, there are no indicators for monitoring child development in the national statistical indicator system and the ministries and branches of Vietnam. The available statistics on the Viet Nam infant development index are obtained from the Children and Women&apos;s Targets Survey, which was collected by the General Statistics Office and UNICEF through the National Development Goals Survey.
