	<data> &lt;p&gt; Greenhouse gas emissions are gaseous components of the atmosphere, including natural gases and gases produced by human activities, that absorb and emit radiation at specific wavelengths in the spectral range. of thermal infrared radiation emitted from the earth&apos;s surface, atmosphere and by clouds These properties cause the greenhouse effect, only the heat-trapping effect in the lower atmosphere by greenhouse gases that absorb radiation from the ground and emit it back to the ground, making the lower atmosphere layer and the earth&apos;s surface warms. Under the Kyoto Protocol, the emissions causing the greenhouse effect is mainly composed of CO 2 &lt;/sub&gt; &lt;sub&gt;, CH 4 &lt;/sub&gt; &lt;sub&gt;, N &lt;/sub&gt; &lt;sub&gt; 2 O, HFCs, PFCs, SF 6 &lt;/sub&gt; &lt;sub&gt;, NF 3 &lt;/sub&gt; &lt;sub&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt; The amount of greenhouse gas emissions calculated as CO emissions &lt;sub&gt; 2 &lt;/sub&gt; , collected nationwide. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
