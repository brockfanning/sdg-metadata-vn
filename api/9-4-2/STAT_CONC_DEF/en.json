If a person spends 30% of his time on research and development and spends the rest of the time on other activities (such as teaching, administrative management at universities; instructing students) that person is only considered. is equivalent to 0.3 FTE. Similarly, if a scientific research and technological development officer is employed full-time but only works for 6 months for a scientific research and technological development unit, this officer is only counted as 0.5 FTE. . </p>\n <p> To calculate the number of FTEs, it is necessary to determine the coefficient of time use for scientific research and technological development of each group of people engaged in scientific research and technological development. </p>"}
