{"status":"success","message":"The COMPARABILITY field for indicator 5-5-5, translated into en","data":" <p> The indicator “Proportion of female directors/business owners and cooperatives” is one of the indicators reflecting the global level indicator “5.5.2: Proportion of women in managerial positions”. At the global level, it is recommended to collect this indicator through workforce surveys or modular integrated surveys of employment. However, in Vietnam, this indicator is collected through the Economic Census and its content is narrower than that of the world, so it does not guarantee international comparability. </p>"}
