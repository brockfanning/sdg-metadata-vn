	<message>The REC_USE_LIM field for indicator 3-2-3, translated into en</message>
	<data> &lt;p&gt; - The accuracy of this indicator depends a lot on the reports of the local health care facilities (medical stations and hospitals). In Vietnam, data from the private health sector has not been collected, so the reported data is incomplete. Therefore, WHO has developed a model to estimate the annual incidence of malaria based on reported data, proportion of reporting units, percentage of reporting units correctly, and through community surveys, private healthcare. &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt; - Estimates of malaria data are highly dependent on the accuracy of reports. If information is inaccurate and up-to-date, estimates are often underestimated. &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt; - Malaria patients include patients with clinical malaria and patients with parasitic malaria. Therefore, in order to determine the risk of disease more accurately, it is recommended to determine the ratio of malaria parasites per 100,000 population. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
