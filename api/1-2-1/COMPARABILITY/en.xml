	<message>The COMPARABILITY field for indicator 1-2-1, translated into en</message>
	<data> &lt;p&gt; The global set of sustainable development indicators uses the indicator “1.3.1. Proportion of population covered by social protection floors/systems, by sex, distinguishing children, unemployed persons, older persons, persons with disabilities, pregnant women, newborns, work-injury victims and the poor and the vulnerable”. However, due to the characteristics of Vietnam, there is no clear concept of the term &quot;social protection&quot;. Social protection is close to the concept of social assistance, which is one of the three basic pillars of the welfare system. With the purpose of overcoming risks, social assistance together with social insurance have the function of reducing risks, and proactive labor market policies to prevent risks for people. Therefore, to replace the global indicator 1.3.1, Vietnam uses the indicator &quot;Number of people paying social insurance, health insurance, unemployment insurance&quot; and some related indicators of Vietnam. like: &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt; 1.2.2. Number of people entitled to social insurance, health insurance and unemployment insurance &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt; 1.2.3. Number of people receiving monthly social support in the community. &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt; 1.2.4. Number of people receiving unexpected social support &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt; 1.2.5. The number of people being raised is concentrated in social protection establishments and social houses. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
