	<message>The QUALITY_ASSURE field for indicator 1-1-3, translated into en</message>
	<data> &lt;p&gt; To ensure the quality of the collected information, the enumerator is not allowed to send the questionnaire to the head of household or household members to record or copy information from other available data sources into the questionnaire. &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt; Quality monitoring measures: Due to the complex nature of the survey, a number of technical measures were used to ensure the quality of the survey data, including: &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt; + Call the household to check the enumerator&apos;s visit and how long it takes to interview the household. &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt; + The interview form is designed with most of the pre-typed codes to reduce re-coding time after data collection and reduce errors. &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt; + The work of 3 investigators was closely examined by a team and supervisor. &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt; + Phuc tra 10% of surveyed households after each survey period. &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt; + The interview form is designed in relatively detail to avoid exploiting omissions of information. The interview form is designed so that the surveyor has a place to write information right on the questionnaire, without having to open an intermediate notebook. Household interview form, the information section is printed 3 lines apart with double lines to help enumerators avoid mistakenly recording the line &lt;/p&gt;</data>
