	<message>The COMPARABILITY field for indicator 1-1-3, translated into en</message>
	<data> &lt;p&gt; Indicator “Rate of children in multidimensional poverty” together with indicator “1.1. Multidimensional poverty rate” are two indicators corresponding to the indicator “1.2.2. Proportion of men, women and children of all ages living in poverty in all its dimensions according to international definitions”. &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt; Although this indicator is built on the global SDG target 1.2.2. However, as recommended by the UN, the data of this indicator is not intended for cross-country comparison because of differences in poverty dimensions and different thresholds for poverty defined in each country. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
