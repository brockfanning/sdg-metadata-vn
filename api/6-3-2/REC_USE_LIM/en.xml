	<data> &lt;p&gt; Data from two different sources, the Ministry of Planning and Investment and the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment. &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt; According to the Ministry of Planning and Investment, the percentage of industrial parks that have come into operation with a centralized wastewater treatment plant in 2019 is 88.6%, higher than the rate of 84.7% in 2015. However, according to the report of the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment, in 2019 the whole country had 242/274 industrial parks in operation with centralized wastewater treatment systems, accounting for 88.3% (in 2018 it was 80%. , in 2017 was 77%). In which, 191 industrial parks have installed automatic and continuous wastewater monitoring equipment, accounting for 78.9%, the remaining 51 industrial parks are in the process of installing automatic wastewater monitoring equipment, accounted for 21.1%. Centralized wastewater treatment systems of industrial parks treat about 71% of generated wastewater (in 2018 it was 42%). &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt; However, the current big challenge is the problem of industrial wastewater treatment in industrial clusters and craft villages, where the rate of wastewater collection and treatment is very low, requiring solutions and policies. breakthrough policy in controlling wastewater quality for these subjects. Besides, it is necessary to further improve the control of water pollution in industrial zones because the high proportion of industrial parks with centralized wastewater treatment systems does not mean that this system is operated regularly. In fact, there has been a case where the factory has a wastewater treatment system but it does not work but still discharges untreated water into the environment &lt;/p&gt;</data>
