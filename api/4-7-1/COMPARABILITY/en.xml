	<message>The COMPARABILITY field for indicator 4-7-1, translated into en</message>
	<data> &lt;p&gt; This indicator reflects the global target “ &lt;strong&gt; 4.c.1: &lt;/strong&gt; Proportion of teachers in: (a) pre-primary; (b) primary; (c) lower secondary; and (d) upper secondary education who have received at least the minimum organized teacher training (e.g. pedagogical training) pre-service or in-service required for teaching at the relevant level in a given country”. Globally, in addition to disaggregated by sex and education level (similar to Vietnam&apos;s), it is also classified by type of organization (public/private). &lt;/p&gt;</data>
