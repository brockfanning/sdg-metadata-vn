	<message>The REC_USE_LIM field for indicator 8-10-1, translated into en</message>
	<data> &lt;p&gt; There are differences in youth and adult age regulations globally as well as by country. &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt; Vietnam stipulates that young people are people aged 16 -30 years old. Meanwhile, the world as well as most other countries regulates the age of 15 years and older. &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt; Therefore, the data for this indicator is calculated for the population aged 15 years and over to ensure international comparability. &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt; - Although it has not reached the level as set out on the roadmap, thanks to the digitization of banking services in recent years, the system of financial institutions and commercial bank branches still meets the requirements of supporting support access to financial services of businesses and people more easily and conveniently &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt; - With the trend of widely applying advanced technologies to develop non-cash payments, along with the rapid development of new electronic payment methods such as e-wallets, e-banking, internet-banking then the expansion of ATMs becomes unnecessary and even a waste of resources. Thus, the use of indicator 8.10.1 to evaluate the results of SDG 8.10 implementation in Vietnam may no longer be appropriate in the current context &lt;/p&gt;</data>
