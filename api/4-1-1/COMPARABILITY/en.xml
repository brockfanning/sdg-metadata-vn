	<message>The COMPARABILITY field for indicator 4-1-1, translated into en</message>
	<data> &lt;p&gt; The indicator “Proportion of pupils attending primary school” is one of the indicators of Vietnam to represent the global sustainable development target “&lt;strong&gt; 4.1.1: &lt;/strong&gt; Proportion of children and young people: ( a) in grades 2/3; (b) at the end of primary; and (c) at the end of lower secondary achieving at least a minimum proficiency level in (i) reading and (ii) mathematics, by sex”. &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt; However, the indicator does not guarantee global comparability because the content, scope and calculation method of Vietnam are not the same as the global standard. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
