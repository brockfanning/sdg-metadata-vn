	<data> &lt;p&gt; Statistics on informality are key to assessing the quality of employment in the economy. In the context of limited social protection coverage, social security benefits (such as unemployment insurance) are insufficient or even absent, or when wages and pensions are low, individuals may have to do informal jobs to secure their livelihood. In these situations, indicators such as the unemployment rate will provide an incomplete picture of the labor market situation, revealing large deficits in the quality of employment. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
